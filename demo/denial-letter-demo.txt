Date: 2026-02-24
Patient: Alex Morgan (pat-001)
Requested Service: Lumbar Spine MRI (without contrast)
Decision: DENIED

Reason for Denial:
Medical necessity was not established based on the submitted documentation.
Current records did not sufficiently demonstrate objective neurologic findings,
failed conservative therapy with duration, or complete prior imaging context.

Clinical policy references:
- Musculoskeletal Imaging Guideline MSK-204 (Lumbar Spine MRI).
- Requires documented neurologic deficit OR red-flag progression with failed conservative treatment.
- Requires clear timeline of symptom persistence and prior treatment response.

Specific findings from review:
- Neurologic exam elements were present but incompletely tied to functional decline.
- Conservative care history was noted but lacked a concise treatment-response summary.
- Prior imaging date was listed, but interpretation context for current symptoms was limited.
- Medical necessity statement did not fully connect objective findings to decision impact.

To Reconsider This Determination, Please Submit:
- Updated clinical note with neurologic exam findings.
- Documentation of conservative therapy duration and outcomes.
- Prior imaging report and relevant interpretation.
- Clarified clinical rationale connecting symptoms to requested MRI.
- Brief payer-facing summary linking each required criterion to chart evidence.
- Any interval worsening, falls, or progression markers since prior imaging.

Appeal Deadline: 2026-03-10
