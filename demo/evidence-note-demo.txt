Encounter Date: 2026-02-20
Rendering Clinician: Jordan Lee, MD
Patient: Alex Morgan (pat-001)

Primary diagnosis: Lumbar radiculopathy
Symptom duration (weeks): 14
Neurologic deficit present: yes
Conservative therapy duration (weeks): 10
Physical therapy trial documented: yes
Date of prior imaging: 2025-10-22

Red flag symptoms: Progressive left leg weakness, persistent radicular pain, functional decline with ambulation.

Clinical rationale: Persistent radicular pain with objective neurologic deficits (left dorsiflexion weakness, sensory loss in L5 distribution) and failure of >8 weeks of conservative therapy support medical necessity for lumbar spine MRI.
Clinical rationale (payer-facing): MRI is required now to evaluate ongoing neurologic compromise, correlate with progressive symptoms, and direct next-step treatment planning after failed non-operative management.
Medical necessity rationale: The requested MRI is medically necessary due to documented neurologic findings, prolonged symptoms, and inadequate response to PT/medication/activity modification.

Assessment summary:
- Positive straight-leg raise on the left at 40 degrees.
- Mild left ankle dorsiflexion weakness (4/5).
- Decreased sensation in L5 dermatome distribution.
- PT and home exercise adherence documented with insufficient improvement.
